    "\n",
    "For this project, we have three dataframes we're currently working with: \n",
    "* twitter_archive - imported tweet info from twitter_archive_enhanced.txt provided by udacity. Has tweet IDs, tweet text, ratings, and other information.\n",
    "* tweets_json - data from twitter API containing retweets, favorited count, tweet text, and more.\n",
    "* image_predictions - results from neural net. Contains three predictions, image url, number of images, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three dataframes provide info about the tweets posted from the WeRateDogs twitter profile. We'll do some assessing of the data before we merge these dataframes together. Then we'll clean the data to get the most complete data set we can.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quality Issues\n",
    "* twitter_archive has 2356 entries, tweets_json has 2340 entries, and image_predictions has 2075 entries\n",
    "* In 'twitter_archive', incorrect and missing names under 'name' column: 'None', 'a', 'the', 'an', etc.\n",
    "* In 'twitter_archive', a few rating numerators are under 10 but according to the twitter profile, all ratings should be above 10\n",
    "* In 'twitter_archive', there's are rows where the 'rating_denominator' is lower or higher than 10. We need to standardize all rows to be out of 10.\n",
    "* In 'twitter_archive', timestamp column is in string format instead of datetime.\n",
    "* In 'image_predicitons', results from the neural net in p1 give us results in inconsistent lower/upper case. Need to make consistent\n",
    "* In 'tweets_json', 'id' column should be renamed to 'tweet_id' to be consistent with other two dataframes\n",
    "* In 'image_predicitons', we get invalid results from our neural net in p1 such as 'desktop_computer', 'electric_fan', 'wild_boar'.\n",
    "* In 'image_predictions', some prediction of dog breeds aren't actual dog breeds\n",
