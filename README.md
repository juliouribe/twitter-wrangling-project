# twitter-wrangling-project

Wrangling project for Udacity. Goal of project is to exercise and develop
wrangling skills by gathering data from multiple sources, assessing data, and
cleaning data.

The data we will be looking it is regarding the twitter profile, WeRateDogs,
which is an account focused on creating tweets about dogs and giving them a
rating out of 10 but always above 10 because "all dogs are good boys".

I will be working with the Twitter API, a text file provided by Udacity, and
a tsv file extracted from a Udacity website using Http requests. I'll then
assess, clean, and present my findings.
